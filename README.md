# Overview
Mobile IP is a communication protocol (created by extending the Internet Protocol) that allows users to move from one network to another while using the same IP address. It ensures that the communication will continue without the userâ€™s sessions or connections being dropped. 

Using Mobile IP, a mobile node is able to roam from its home network to any foreign network while being always reachable through its home IP address.


This is a partial implementation of the [RFC 5944](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5944) specification. If you have any questions, comments or need any additional support, contact us on juakali.networks@gmail.com. 

Feel free to contact us if you need us to implement for you any network protocol. The auto tests used for this project can be found here (https://github.com/juakali-networks/mip/tree/master/tests). You can also contact us if you need us to create automatic tests for any protocols that you are implementing or any network devices you are developing. 


Basic use case of mip be demonstrated using the diagram below.

# Usage
Three Virtual machines (VMs) or PCs

VM_1, VM_2 and VM_3.

Run the commands on the VMs in the following order

On VM_1 (Foreign Agent) and VM_2 (Mobile Node), run the commands below to enable dynamic tunnel creation.

<pre>sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1</pre>



On VM_2 (Mobile Node)

<pre>sudo ./mip/src/mip -r </pre>

Mobile Node sends Registration Request (RREQ) packet to Foreign Agent, on receieving the Agent Advertisement packet

On VM_1 (Foreign Agent)

<pre>sudo ./mip/src/mip -n </pre>

Foreign Agent sends RREQ packet with care of Address to Home Agent on receiving the RREQ packet from Mobile Node

On VM_3 (Home Agent)

<pre>sudo ./mip/src/mip -q </pre>

Home Agent sends Registration Reply (RREP) packet back to Foreign Agent on receiving the RREQ packet

On VM_1 (Foreign Agent)

<pre>sudo ./mip/src/mip -m </pre>

Foreign Agent sends multicast agent advertisement packet
